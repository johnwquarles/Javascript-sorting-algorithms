# Get Sorted

Get Sorted is a Node.js command-line application that will run one of several
sorting algorithms for you and present, in gorgeous ANSI color, what it did to
complete the sort.

From the main menu, enter the number of the algorithm you'd
like to see, followed by the number of randomly-placed numbers that will comprise
the starting array. Then check out what the computer did to put things in order.

### To install and use (Mac):
